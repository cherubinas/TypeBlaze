# TypeBlaze
About the project ( TypeBlaze game ):

The TypeBlaze project is a game focused on testing usersâ€™ capabilities to type in
simple English, difficult English, and code lines. The game is being developed using
the Java programming language.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a fun and engaging way for users to
improve their typing skills. By playing the game, users will be able to practice typing
at a faster and more accurate pace, thereby enhancing their overall efficiency in
tasks that require typing.

To ensure that users are making progress, the game will track how quickly and
accurately they type the text presented to them. It will also keep track of any typing
mistakes made by the user during gameplay. When the user decides to finish playing
or when the provided text segment ends a results table will be displayed, showing the
user's name (typed in before starting the game) and score. After that, the user can
choose whether to continue playing or exit the game.

Overall, the TypeBlaze project is an innovative solution to the problem of slow and
inaccurate typing. By providing a fun and engaging game that encourages users to
improve their typing skills, the project has the potential to make a significant
contribution to the field of language learning.

Tools and technologies:

The project TypeBlaze will be made using the Java programming language, including the UI.
Our IDE of choice will be Visual Studio Code. It will be used for everything from GUI to
database. Visual Studio Code (VSC) is a free code editor made by Microsoft for Windows,
iOS, and Linux. The Wikitext extension provides functional support for the Wikitext language
with MediaWiki wikis. It was chosen due to its ability to easily code as a team and make
changes fast.

Libraries:
The third-party libraries include SWING - which provides a set of "lightweight" (all-Java
language) components used for GUI that, to the maximum degree possible, work the same
on all platforms, and TIMER - which provides a method call that is used by a thread to
schedule a task, such as running a block of code after some regular instant of time. Each
task may be scheduled to run once or for repeated executions. Each timer object is
associated with a background thread responsible for the execution of all the tasks of a timer
object.
